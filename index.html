              During the past eight years, I have worked exclusively in the "dot org" space
              (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.salesforce.org/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> for the
              nonprofit and education sectors). I have been a speaker at several conferences including Salesforce.org
              <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/form/sfdo/edu/watch-higher-ed-summit-2019/">Higher Education
                Summit</a>,

              <br /> <br />
              My first exposure to Salesforce was when I worked for
              <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aidslifecycle.org/" target="_blank">AIDS/LifeCycle</a>.
              I discovered that I was quite good at understanding and using the platform. In short order, I became the
              delegated administrator for the Los Angeles office. People like me who don't seek out to be Salesforce
              professionals, but become one accidentally are often referred to as Accidental Admins. In this role, I
              learned declarative development skills and the fundamentals of the platform. These skills allowed me the
              opportunity and experience to seek out a Salesforce administrator position with the
              <a href="https://nursing.utah.edu/" target="_blank">University of Utah College of Nursing</a>.
              <br /> <br />
              Over the next four years, I was afforded the freedom to grow and expand the role. I became the architect
              guiding a major expansion of how the college used the platform, including an application for admission, a
              unified case management solution, and email communication. During the final year, I designed and developed
              an
              internal faculty community using a combination of Community Cloud, Education Cloud, Lightning Web
              Components,
              Aura Components, and Visualforce. We called this product the Faculty Resources Education Database or FRED.
              The college has partnered with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pivotcenter.utah.edu/"
                target="_blank">PIVOT Center</a>
              with the hopes of packaging and commercializing FRED and make it available to the greater higher education
              community ia the Salesforce AppExchange (for this and all Salesforce products, be aware of the companies
              forward-looking
              statement). Since leaving the University of Utah, I have joined the implementation team with Enrollment
              Rx,
              a Salesforce independent software vendor (ISV) partner. We work with higher education Salesforce customers
              and build a suite of products used to create seamless recruitment, admissions, and decision solutions.
              <br /><br />
              I consider myself a constant learner. In 2019, I completed my third master's degree. This one was a Master
              of Science in Information Systems. The other two are a Master of Arts in Geography and a Master of Public
              Administration. If I come across something that I need to know, I seek out a way to learn it. My quest
              for knowledge has driven me to LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com) to learn how to build formulas in
              Microsoft Excel; Pluralsight to learn JavaScript, Apex, and Business Analysis; and Toastmasters to be a
              better communicator. Beyond these hard and soft skills, I also strive to be a better citizen of humanity
              pursuing social justice, fairness, and equality.</p>
